# MovieList

Done the search functionality with proper loading and error handling with simple UI. Did not concetate much on the UI.
Written the major functionaliy Unit test cases and UI Tests.( Still I can cover more on the Network api)
Written Simple Network call api without using the any other framework

Done all these requirements mentioned in the assigment.

Kept code to the criteria ( Readability -- All the names with group )

Used MVVM architecture for better organization of code.

All the constants are properly managed.

Data can be stored in other persistant storage. Currently using UserDefaults.

Handled the erros.

Used Github for dev.

Given all the above, I think there can be improvements in UI and some error handling. Given time frame I have done this. Please let me know if you need more infomation about in detail.

Thanks.
